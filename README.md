# SpectroscopicStandards

Choosing a spectroscopic standard star is a routine procedure in spectroscopic observations. Some of these stars were adopted well before the digital age when the sharing, comparing and visulising information were not trieval tasks. In this webpage, we provide a minimally interative web tool for visualising all the standard stars available from [ESO](https://eso.org/sci/observing/tools/standards.html), [ING](https://www.ing.iac.es//Astronomy/observing/manuals/html_manuals/tech_notes/tn065-100/workflux.html) and [iraf](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/tree/main/noao/lib/onedstds).

The webpage generated from the scripts in this repository can be found at:
